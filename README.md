# Data-Analysis
Analysis of various datasets using Python or R

The first one is analysis of movie ratings dataset from grouplens. The folder can be found here. For bigger dataset, you can visit grouplens.org.
I have tried my best to make it like a code along, so that you, dear reader, can also learn basis of data analysis, if you're not aware of it already. 

I will be updating it more, and also do analysis of different datasets. If you know any interesting daatset to play around, do let me know! :)
